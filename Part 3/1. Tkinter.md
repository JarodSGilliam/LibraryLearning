# Tkinter

##### What Tkinter does

To work with tkinter, you must import it. It is customary to abreviate the name to `tk`.

```python
import tkinter as tk
```


## Window

### Creating
```python
suit_case = tk.Tk()
suit_case.mainloop()
```

### Setting size
```python
suit_case.geometry("460x550")
```
Yes, it is a `str` with this formating. I have no idea why they did it this way.

### Disallowing changing size
```python
self.resizable(False, False)
```

### Background Color
```python
suit_case.configure(bg='#fefbdc')
```

The color is in the HEX format. `#fefbdc` is the color I chose as the background for this project.

## Buttons

```python
button = tk.Button(suit_case, text="Press me")
button.pack()
```

> Note
> If you do not specify a size, the winow will shrink to the smallest size it can to hold the elements in it.
> Example:
> ```Python
> suit_case = tk.Tk()
> button = tk.Button(suit_case, text="Press me")
> button.pack()
> suit_case.mainloop()
> ```

If you want to add a function that __does not__ have any parameters:

``` python
def print_one(to_print):
    print(to_print)

a = 1
button = tk.Button(suit_case, text="Press me to do something", command= print_one)
```

If you want to use a function that takes __the same__ paramerter every time:

``` python
def print_one(to_print):
    print(to_print)

a = 1
button = tk.Button(suit_case, text="Press me to do something", command=lambda : print_one("input"))
```

If you want to use a functions whose parameter can change:

``` python
def print_one(to_print):
    print(to_print)

for i in range(5):
    button = tk.Button(suit_case, text="Press me to do something", command=lambda to_print=i : print_one(to_print))
```

Why does this require `lambda`? Just a quirk of the way `tkiner` works.

> Note
> You can technically not use lambda but `tkinter` starts acting weird.
> For example, if you want to display several buttons using a for loop like this:
> ```python
> for i in range(10):
>    button = tk.Button(suit_case, text="Button", command=print_one(i))
>```
> It will print ten buttons but all of them will print 9. This is because `print_one(i)` is being activated when you actually press the button and so the code looks up the value of `i` only at that point, long after the for loop has been completed. Since the for loop stops updating the `i` variable on the last iteration of the loop, the `i` variable is left with the last number that it was set to, here 9.

## Text
```python
tk.Label(self, text="DETECTIVE GAME", font=('Helvetica', 32, "bold")).pack()
```

Update a label
```python
def update_label(a):
    a["text"] = "HI"

a : tk.Label = tk.Label(suit_case, text="DETECTIVE GAME", font=('Helvetica', 32, "bold"))
```
Must be done in a function.


## Organization

> Note
> Pack and grid cannot coexist.

### Pack
Just sticks it under the previous item
```python
button.pack()
```


### Grid
```python
button.grid(row=2, column=0)
```

## Frame
A mini-suitcase that you can put in the bigger suit case. Can use a differnt organizational system
