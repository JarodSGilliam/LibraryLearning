# Python Programming Parts 1-3 at the Athens Library
This GitHub repository contains thorough notes, code snippets to copy and paste, and the completed project as a preview.

## The class
Learn the basics of Python through Game Design! Over the course of the three classes, you will be given the tools needed to build a simple visual novel detective game and the fundamentals needed to make more complex games.

### Part 1:
We plan to cover variables, Boolean Logic, if else, and loops.

### Part 2:
We plan to cover importing, classes, functions, and OOP.

### Part 3:
We plan to cover how to add visuals using Tkinter.
