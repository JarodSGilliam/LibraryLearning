# Object Oriented Programming aka OOP
This is a bit more of an advanced concept, but using it makes creating the game easier. It involves thinking of the software we want to build as a collection of objects and creating a class to represent each of these objects. Then, you program the classes interactions as if they were actual physical objects reacting in the real world.

## Encapsulation
Put everything related to an object inside the object.
```python
class Suspect():
    def __init__(self, name, questions):
        self.name = name
        self.questions = questions
```

```python
questions_dict = {
    "Suspect_1": ["Question_list"]
}

class Suspect():
    def __init__(self, name, questions):
        self.name = name
```

## Abstraction
Make it so the person using the type does not have to understand any of the details about how it works under the hood.

```python
class Suspect():
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self._private = name[0].upper()
```

## Inheritance
An object can be a subtype of another object.

Ex. (a square is a type of rectangle where the sides are all the same length)

```python
class Suspect():
    def __init__(self, name : str) -> None:
        self.name = name

class Villian(Suspect):
    def __init__(self, name : str) -> None:
        super.__init__(self, name)
```

## Polymorphism
Make it so we can call the same method on any type a variable is likely to be set to.
```python
class Suspect():
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name

    def checkVillainy(self) -> bool:
        return False

class Villian(Suspect)
    def checkVillany(self) -> bool:
        return True

character.checkVillany()
```
