We can create our own functions just like `print`. To do so, we must define what they do. To do so, we type the keyword `def` (short for define), type the function name, add a semicolon, and then just like the `while` or `if` indent the code underneath it.

```python
def say_hi():
    print("hi")
```

If we want to be able to give the function things to work with, we must set up the variables to store that information in. These variables are called "parameters".

```python
def say_something(the_something):
    print(the_something)
```

Putting things in functions can be used to reduce repetition. There is an old programming mantra, "don't repeat yourself". The idea is one should never have to write the same piece of code twice. This makes you work faster and makes it easier to make changes in multiple places without having to remember every spot in a huge number of files where you wrote the same code.


### For this project

I want to separate a lot of things into functions to make the code easier to understand. For one, we can separate the printing of the dialogue. This allows us to read the code more easily and makes it simpler for us to change who we are speaking with.

```python
def print_text(name, dialogue):
    print(name)
    print(" " + dialogue + "\n")
    print("Ask a question:")
    print(' 1 - "Are you the thief?"')
    print(' 2 - "Did you witness anything?"')
    print(" e - Exit")
```

If we incorporate lists, we can make it even more generic.

```python
questions = ['"Are you the thief?"', '"Did you witness anything?"']

def print_text(name, dialogue, questions):
    print(name)
    print(" " + dialogue + "\n")
    print("Ask a question:")
    print(' 1 - ' + questions[0])
    print(' 2 - ' + questions[1])
    print(" e - Exit")
```

Making the function more generic makes it even easier to change which suspect is being interviewed. This is another advantage of functions.

Now, what if there are more than two questions? We can determine how many questions are in the array and then go over each one and display its corresponding number.

```python
def print_text(name, dialogue, questions):
    print(name)
    print(" " + dialogue + "\n")
    print("Ask a question:")
    for i in range(len(questions)):
        print(' ' + str(i + 1) + ' - "' + questions[i] + '"')
    print(" e - Exit")
```

The rest of the code becomes:

```python
while(True):
    os.system('cls||clear')
    print_text("Sir Regenald", dialogue, ["Are you the thief?", "Did you witness anything?", "Who do you think did it?"])
    users_input = input("Select an option: ")
    if (users_input == "1"):
        dialogue = "No. Absolutely not!" + "\n How DARE you accuse me of that!"
    elif (users_input == "2"):
        dialogue = "Well, I did see someone running across the rooftop last night at midnight."
    else:
        break
```


### Return

We may want to send back the information out of the function. Remember how some functions replace themselves? You can make your function do this as well using the `return` keyword.

```python
def add_five(to_add_to):
    return to_add_to + 5

print(add_five(5))
```

If run, the print statement will turn into:

```python
print(8)
```

Using this, we have everything we need to interview different suspects.
