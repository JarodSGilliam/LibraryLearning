# Classes

To create your own type of variable, you can define a class:

```python
class a_class():
    def __init__(self):
        print("initalized")
```

Then you can set a varaible to an example of that class just like you would set a variable to an `int`.

```python
a_number : int = 5
a_class_object : a_class = a_class()
```

Writing `a_class()` runs the init function and creates an object of that class. By adding variables to that init class we can add subvariables that live within an example of that class.

```python
class cat():
    def __init__(self, name, color):
        self.name = name
        self.color = color
```

This way, if we have a bunch of differnt examples of that class, instead of having to make a name variable for each one, we can just access the name of the object.

So this code:

```python
cat1_name = "Rocket"
cat1_color = "orange"
cat2_name = "Skitter"
cat2_color = "white"
print(cat1_name + " is " + cat1_color)
print(cat2_name + " is " + cat2_color)
```

Is simplified to this:

```python
cats = [cat("Rocket", "orange"), cat("Skitter", "white")]
for cat in cats:
    print(cat.name + " is " + cat.color)
```

The simplifed code makes it MUCH easier to add a cat or remove a cat if something changes.


### For this project
Currently in the project, our suspect is represented by a bunch of different variables (name, dialogue, questions, answers). Having four variables for each suspect can get unmanagable if we have dozens of suspects (requiring 24 * 5 = 120 variables). We can use classes to simplify.

```python
class suspect():
    def __init__(self, name, dialogue, questions, answers):
        self.name = name
        self.dialogue = dialogue
        self.questions - questions
        self.answers = answers
```

If we create a suspect class, we can hold all of the data that is releated to a given suspect within a single `suspect` variable.

Now, we can refactor (change) the code so that we can give it a `suspect` and it will automatically do the interview for us.

```python
class suspect():
    def __init__(self, name, starting_dialogue, questions, answers):
        self.name = name
        self.starting_dialogue = starting_dialogue
        self.questions - questions
        self.answers = answers

def conduct_interview(suspect):
    dialogue = suspect.starting_dialogue
    while(True):
        os.system('cls||clear')
        print_text(suspect.name, suspect.dialogue, suspect.questions)
        users_input = input("Select an option: ")
        if (users_input == "e"):
            break
        else:
            dialogue = suspect.answers[int(users_input)-1]

suspects = [suspect("Sir Regenald", "Hello my good man.", ["Are you the theif?", "Did you witness anything?", "Who do you think did it?"], ["No. Absolutely not!" + "\n How DARE you accuse me of that!", "Well, I did see someone running across the rooftop last night at midnight.", "I have no idea, unfortunately."])]

for suspect in suspects:
    conduct_interview(suspect)
```

While this code may look complex, it is actually much easier then the previous code. If simply defines the list of suspects, then conducts an interview with each one.
