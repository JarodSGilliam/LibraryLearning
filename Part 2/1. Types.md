Everything that can be stored in a variable is associated with a type. For example the number 1 is an `int` and the text "hi" is a `str`.

`int` is short for integer and any whole number is of this type.
```python
a_variable = 1
```
`str` is short for string (as in a string of characters) and any text is of this type.
```python
a_variable = "hello"
```
`float` is short for floating point number and any number that can be written with values beyond a decimal point is of this type.
```python
a_variable = 1.0
```
`list` is the type of a list.
```python
a_variable = [1, 2, 3]
```
`tuple` is like a list but of a unchangeable length.
```python
a_variable = (1, 2, 3)
```
`dict` is short for dictionary and associates things with other things.
```python
a_variable = {
    "a" : "b",
    "c" : "d",
    "e" : "e",
}
```
`set` is a list that does not allow duplicate entries.
```python
a_variable = {1, 2, 3}
```
`bool` is short for Boolean and can only be `True` or `False`.
```python
a_variable = True
```
`NoneType` is a representation of when nothing is being stored in a variable.
```python
a_variable = None
```
(and more rare ones)

In other languages, you have to tell the computer what type a variable is going to be before you set its value (contents). But Python does not care. This makes Python run slightly slower than other languages but makes it more flexible and easier to use. However, if you a variable that is always going to be one type and will only end up as a different type if there has been an error, you can give the computer a hint that this variable should only ever be the one type using "Type Hinting".

```python
counter : int = 0
```

If you want to convert a variable to a specific type, use the type name like it is a function.

```python
inputted_text : str = input()
inputted_number : int= int(inputted_text)
```

In the above example, input always returns a string. If the user gives the program a number, it will be converted into an int. If the user typed in something else (like a character or a word), the computer will freak out and the program will crash (stop executing immediately and show you in the command line on what line the error that caused the crash occurred). *Note1

### Methods

Knowing the type of a variable is important because of methods. Methods are functions that are associated with a specific type and thus written slightly differently. Instead of putting the variable inside the parenthesis, you put it first.

```python
name = "george"
name = name.capitalize()
```

You must know the type of the variable. For example if you want to add a item, the method that you would call is different depending on if the variable is a list or a set.

```python
test_list.append("a new item")
test_set.add("a new item")
```

Trying to use `.append()` on a `set` or `.add()` on a `list` will not work.



We can create our own types, but just to be confusing they are called classes.

### Type hints/annotation
In Python you do not have to tell the computer what the type of a variable will be. You can also save 

### For this project

```python
user_input : str = input()
if (user_input == "e"):
    break
else:
    selected_number = int(user_input)
```


## Notes

### Try except

In the above case, we don't know what the user will give us. In a real program, we can't assume that they will be nice and do what we want. Well, in this class we can for simplicity's sake, but if we weren't making that assumption, we would ask the computer to try and run it and then help it deal with the error if it occurred like this:

```python
inputted_text : str = input()
try:
    inputted_number : int= int(inputted_text)
except:
    print("Please type in a number.")
```
