# Loops

How do we let the user ask a question multiple times? We could just paste the same code multiple times, but we don't know how many times the user will want to ask questions (may want to ask the same question multiple times if they are forgetful). There is a solution though.

### While
A `while` is like an `if` statement, except instead of only executing the code in the case that something is `True`, it will execute the code over and over until the something remains `True`.

```python
while(input() == "1")
    print("input is still one")
```

If you want some code to repeat forever:

```python
while(True)
    print("hi")
```

### For
If you want to run the code for each item in a list or a specific number of times use the `for` loop.

This code will print each item in the list on a new line. What is typed between `for` and `in` becomes a variable with the current item in the list for each iteration (time the code is run).

```python
for a in a_list:
    print(a)
```

This code will print the word "hi" five times. The range function creates a list (technically a sequence but a list for our purposes) of numbers from 0 up to (but not including) the number given. The `_` was used to tell the computer that I don't want to deal with having a variable with each item in the list.

```python
for _ in range(5):
    print("hi")
```

### Continue and break

What if you want to escape a loop early? Use the `break` keyword. It breaks out of the loop and the code moves on to the next line of code under the loop.

```python
while(True)
    if (input() == "exit"):
        break
```

What if you want to move on to the next iteration of the loop before finishing (and never finishing) this one? Use the `continue` keyword. It continues on to the next iteration immediately.

```python
while(True)
    if (input() == "hi"):
        continue
    print('You typed something other than "hi"')
```


### For this project

Now we can allow the player to ask multiple questions of the suspect. Implementing this, the code now looks like this:

```python
dialogue = "Hello my good man."
while(True):
    print("Sir Regenald")
    print(" " + dialogue + "\n")
    print("Ask a question:")
    print(' 1 - "Are you the thief?"')
    print(' 2 - "Did you witness anything?"')
    print(" e - Exit")
    users_input = input("Select an option: ")
    if (users_input == "1"):
        dialogue = "No. Absolutely not!" + "\n How DARE you accuse me of that!"
    elif (users_input == "2"):
        dialogue = "Well, I did see someone running across the rooftop last night at midnight."
    else:
        break
```


If you run this code, it will look really ugly. To fix this, add these lines below. We will discuss the concepts behind them at a later date, but what they do is clear the command line. I advise adding them because it is distracting working on the game without them.

The lines:
```python
import os
os.system('cls||clear')
```

Place the first as the first line in the document. Place the second as the first line within the while loop.

```python
import os
dialogue = "Hello my good man."
while(True):
    os.system('cls||clear')
    print("Sir Regenald")
    print(" " + dialogue + "\n")
    print("Ask a question:")
    print(' 1 - "Are you the thief?"')
    print(' 2 - "Did you witness anything?"')
    print(" e - Exit")
    users_input = input("Select an option: ")
    if (users_input == "1"):
        dialogue = "No. Absolutely not!" + "\n How DARE you accuse me of that!"
    elif (users_input == "2"):
        dialogue = "Well, I did see someone running across the rooftop last night at midnight."
    else:
        break
```
