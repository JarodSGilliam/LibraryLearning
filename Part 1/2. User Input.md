We gave the player several options of which question to ask. We need a way to know which one the user selected. To do this we need the player to input a selection, so we use the ```input``` function to let a player make that choice.

```python
input()
```
You can give the input function text and it will print it. When run the function waits until the user types something and then replaces itself with what was typed.
By replaces itself I mean that this code
```python
print(input())
```
would wait for the user to type something (here ```hi```) and then it would run the code as if it had always been:
```python
print("hi")
```
It would thus print the word ```hi``` to the command line.
