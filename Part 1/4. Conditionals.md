# Conditionals

### If
Currently, while the player can tell the player which question they want to ask the interviewee, the code can't do anything with that information except display it back to the user. We need to test the input to see if it is "1" or "2". To do this, we use the if command.

If checks to see if whatever is placed the parenthesis is true and if so, runs a specific bit of code. Note the semicolon at the end of the parenthesis. That is a required part of most statements like this.

```python
if (a_variable): print("That's true")
```

What if you want to print two things, one only if a variable is set to `True` and another afterwards, no matter what the variable is set to? Or what if you want to put multiple lines under the same if? To do so, we need a way for the computer to understand what is a part of the if statement and what is not. This is done by using a tab. So, the code for the first possibility would look like this:

```python
if (a_variable):
    print("That's true")
print("Anyway")
```

It works a lot like bullet points
 - this is a bullet point
  - this is a sub-bullet point that is a part of the above bullet point
  - so is this
    - and this is a sub-bullet point of "so is this"
  - this too

If you want to do an if statement in an if statement, just use more tabs:

```python
if (a_variable):
    print("That's true")
    if (a_second_variable):
        print("That's true also")
    print("That's still true")
print("Anyway")
```

### Else
What if you want to do something when the variable is `True` and something else when it is `False`? You could do this with the `not` keyword:

```python
if (a_variable):
    print("That's true")
if (not a_variable):
    print("That's not true")
```

But it turns out this is done so commonly that it has been simplified. You can add the keyword `else` to any if statement to handle the `False` possibility (called a case).

```python
if (a_variable):
    print("first selected")
else:
    print("second selected")
```

### Equations

Most things are not `True` or `False`, for example the user's input will be a number, so we need to check what it is using an equation of some kind. This is because an equation is always (and only) either `True` or `False`.

Now, one would think that we could use:

```python
a_variable = 5
1+1 = 2
```

just like in math, but since we have already used this to set variables, it will just confuse the computer (no it can't just figure it out contextually, a computer cannot tell the difference between the two equations above in any meaningful way). To overcome this problem, we just stretch out the equal sign into `==`.

So if we want to check if the user selected 1:

```python
if (input() == "1"):
    print("The input was 1")
else:
    print("The input was not 1")
```

### Elif

We currently need to check if the input is 1 or if the input is two and say different things depending.

```python
if (input() == "1"):
    print("The input was 1")
else:
    print("The input was not 1")
    if (input() == "2"):
        print("The input was 2")
    else:
        print("The input was not 1 or 2")
```

This is already a bit clunky but imagine if we had five questions.

```python
the_input = input()
if (the_input == "1"):
    print("The input was 1")
else:
    if (the_input == "2"):
        print("The input was 1 or 2")
    else:
        if (the_input == "3"):
            print("The input was 1 or 2 or 3")
        else:
            if (the_input == "4"):
                print("The input was 1 or 2 or 3 or 4")
            else:
                if (the_input == "5"):
                    print("The input was 5")
                else:
                    print("The input was not 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5")
```

Or a hundred.

There is an easier way of doing this *Note 1, if you'll notice the others and if are really near together, so we just squash them into one keyword: `elif`. This simplifies the above code to:

```python
the_input = input()
if (the_input == "1"):
    print("The input was 1")
elif (the_input == "2"):
    print("The input was 1 or 2")
elif (the_input == "3"):
    print("The input was 1 or 2 or 3")
elif (the_input == "4"):
    print("The input was 1 or 2 or 3 or 4")
elif (the_input == "5"):
    print("The input was 5")
else:
    print("The input was not 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5")
```

This makes it much easier to read, which is very important to programmers.

### or and and

What if you want to do something if the variable is equivalent to 1 or 2? Use the `or` keyword.

```python
the_input = input()
if (the_input == "1" or the_input == "2"):
    print("Either is true")
else
    print("The input was not 1 or 2")
```

What if you want to do something if the two variables are both equivalent to 1? Use the `and` keyword.

```python
if (the_first_input == "1" and the_second_input == "1"):
    print("Both")
else
    print("One of them was not 1 or both of them were not 1")
```

What if you want to do something if the variable is not equivalent to 1? Use the `not` keyword.

```python
the_input = input()
if (not the_input == "1"):
    print("The input was something else")
else
    print("The input was 1")
```

### For this project

We can now determine what the user typed in and respond to each question.

```Python
users_input = input("Select an option: ")
if (users_input == "1"):
    print("No. Absolutely not!")
    print("How DARE you accuse me of that!")
elif (users_input == "2"):
    print("Well, I did see someone running across the rooftop last night at midnight.")
else:
    print("Select a valid command to ask a question.")
```



## Notes
> Note 1
There is another easier way of doing this, but only because we are checking the same variable every time. This way is called a switch statement, and it looks like this:

```python
the_input = input()
match the_input:
    case "1":
        print("The input was 1")
    case "2":
        print("The input was 2")
    case "3":
        print("The input was 3")
    case "4":
        print("The input was 4")
    case "5":
        print("The input was 5")
    case _:
        print("The input was not 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5")
```
