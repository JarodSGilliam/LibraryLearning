Our python file is getting a little long. Python generally likes to put everything in one file, but this can get confusing, and every other language will split up unrelated parts of the code into different files to make the final product easier to read for those programmers who may want to make improvements subject to their tastes or fix unforeseeable errors in the future. I think that moving these classes we have created into another file will make it a bit easier to work on the code.

Remember that computers are not able to read your mind, and thus if you simply move the classes into another file, even one right next to your main one, the computer will have no idea what class you are talking about if you try to make an object of this type. We must explicitly tell the computer to go look in this new file. Doing so is called importing.

### File naming
Python files should always be all lowercase with underscores instead of spaces. The file in part 1 breaks these rule, if I was to make it follow them it would look like this.

```
6. Code at the end of part 1.py
```
would become:
```
6._code_at_the_end of_part_1.py
```

Imports do not work on files with spaces in their name. The underscore rule exists to allow any python file to be imported into any other. 

Following these rules makes filenames consistent no matter which programmer wrote them.

### For this project
I moved the classes into a file named "classes_file.py". To import them after this, I use the below in the file I want to give access to the code in the other file.

```python
import classes_file
```
> Note:
>> You should NOT need to import file 1's code into file 2 AND file 2's code into file 1. If you need to do this, you should not separate the code into separate files. There should always be one main file you are importing into and other files you are importing from.
>> In other words, you should only ever import file 1's code into file 2 OR file 2's code into file 1.

### Import conflicts
Importing like above brings a complication that one would not expect. You will have to preface every use of the other file's code with the name of the file being imported from.

```python
import classes_file

classes_file.Suspect(name="Suspect_1", starter_dialogue="a", location=(1, 1))
```

This is required because files often use the same names for certain functions. So if there are two files you are importing and both have a function named `print_errors`, adding the name of the file tells the code which file's function it should use.

```python
import classes_file
import other_file

other_file.print_errors()
```

> Note:
>> The type of error that is prevented this way is called a "naming conflicts".
>> Officially, a naming conflict is when two different things are named the same thing and there is no indication to which a given reference or invocation of that name is supposed to be pointing.

### Name shorting

When a filename is really long or annoying to type, you can shorten it. Generally, the shortened nickname is the first letters of each word, but as long as it is obvious to which file you are referring, the nickname does not matter.

```python
import classes_file as cf

cf.Suspect(name="Suspect_1", starter_dialogue="a", location=(1, 1))
```

### Specificity

It is possible to import only a specific element (class, function, etc.) from a file.

```python
from classes_file import Suspect

Suspect(name="Suspect_1", starter_dialogue="a", location=(1, 1))
```

Note that when you import something like this, you do not have to specify which file it came from.

### Importing everything

You can use the above method to import everything in the file. If you don't want to type out each element one by one, you can type a `*`.

```python
from classes_file import *

Suspect(name="Suspect_1", starter_dialogue="a", location=(1, 1))
```
